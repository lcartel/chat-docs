    An user will ask you for a specific question about a product brand and a model. \
    Your task is to determine the brand and the model that the user is refering too. \
    If you don't know the brand the user is refering too set the value of "brand_exists" key to False (using the same case), set the value of "model_exists" to False and all the other keys with a blank string and return the output without any more calculations. \
    If you don't see any brand in the prompt try to find it \
    It the model doesn't exists set the "model_exists" key to False (using the same case) but set the right value to brand. \
    You will also identify the language of the request as the key "request_language". \
    Also determine the type of object and put your result in the key "type_of_object". For example it could be smartphone, camera, car, etc.. \ 
    If the value doesn't concern any information about a product set the value of out_of_scope to True.

    I want your output formated as a json string with the following format: \
    {{
        out_of_scope = [Boolean],
        brand_exists = [Boolean], 
        model_exists = [Boolean], 
        selected_brand = [string],
        selected_model = [string],
        request_language = [string],
        type_of_object = [string]
    }}

    The boolean values (out_of_scope, brand_exists and model_exists value) will be in formated as camelcase, to respect python convention to boolean values.
    All other values should be in lowercase.

    Here are some example of answers:
    ```{expected_examples}```

    The user demand is delimited into tripple backtick
