More experienced runners tend to exhibit shorter ground contact times, \\nlower vertical oscillation, lower vertical ratio, and higher cadence than less experienced runners. However, taller \\nrunners typically have slightly slower cadences, longer strides, and slightly higher vertical oscillation. Vertical \\nratio is your vertical oscillation divided by stride length.
